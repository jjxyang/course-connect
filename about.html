    <br>
    <h3 class="display-4">Why did you make this site?</h3>
      This is a web project developed by Howe Cui and Jessie Yang for
      <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS194_3047/">CS 194-32: Computing for Social Good</a>!
      <br><br>
      We created this platform to help students find each other when they'd like help.
      Berkeley is a big campus with a lot of people.
      Sometimes you feel a little lost or you'd like someone to lend an ear.
      Sometimes you'd like to help out when you're able to.
      So, we're striving to foster a culture of collaboration, community, and support,
        enabling users with a tool that starts—but does not end!—at academic collaboration.
